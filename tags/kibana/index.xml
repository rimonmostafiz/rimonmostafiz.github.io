    <description><![CDATA[Installing Kibana and Console Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch and Console (Previously its name was Sence, Sence was renamed to Console and it is available on Kibana 5) Kibana provides an interactive console for submitting requests to Elasticsearch directly from your browser.
The Console plugin provides a UI to interact with the REST API of Elasticsearch. The console has two main areas: the editor, where you compose requests to Elasticsearch, and the response pane, which displays the responses to the request.]]></description>
