      <title>Manage JDK Using SDKMAN</title>

      <description>What is SDKMAN? If you are a developer then its very common that you work on multiple projects which use different JDK version. Obviously, you can use update-alternatives to manage multiple JDK libraries on the same system to select which one you want to use as the main one.
Did you ever tried the update-alternatives and then java -version was correct, but the link in $JAVA_HOME and javac -version was still wrong&amp;hellip; and you changed that one manually?</description>
