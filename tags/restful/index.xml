      <description>Getting Started with Elasticsearch Basics This week finally I started learning Elasticsearch, I decided to keep some notes and share my concepts and understanding on this blog. So that if anyone wants to learn Elasticsearch he/she can learn with me.
In this part, I will write about the some Elasticsearch theory and basic concepts anyone needs to understand. Most of them I learned form ElasticsearchÂ official site and some videos on youtube.</description>
