      <description>Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two number a and b is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero.
int lcm(int a, int b) { for ( int i = 1; ; i ) { if ( i % a == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i % b == 0 ) { return i; } } } There is an another technique for LCM finding called Reduction by the greatest common divisor</description>

      <description>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two number a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b evenly.
if g = gcd(a, b), then g divides both a and b when at least one of them is non zero.
when gcd(a, b) == 1 then we said a and b is co-prime or relatively prime numbers.
int gcd (int a, int b) { int g; for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt;= min(a, b); i++) { if (a%i == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b%i == 0) { g = i; } } return g; } Now there is a much more efficient algorithm for finding GCD which is called Subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm.</description>
