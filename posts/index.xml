    <description><![CDATA[Do you know sudo can insult you? wait, what ❓ 😕
Take a look at what I&rsquo;m talking about. sudo can insult you for typing incorrect password. 💥
Enable insults in sudo Open a terminal and type:
$ sudo visudo  This should open the configuration file in your default editor. In ubuntu like distros, it will be opened in nano.
Now you will have to find the section where the defaults are listed.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This post is about how can we install, update, uninstall and list out installed global packages of NPM.
The commands that start with $ are meant to be run in the terminal or command line.
The output of the command will follow immediately. Comments will begin with #.
Install Global Packages $ npm install -g &lt;package&gt;  For example, to install express globally, type
$ npm install -g express + express@4.]]></description>

A weeks ago, I moved this site over from WordPress to HUGO(a static site generator). Also its now hosted to Netlify(🆓)
This is my attempt to making everything more simple and content-focused. In this post, I will talk about some of my reasons for switching away from WordPress to a static site generator.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Node Version Manager (NVM) is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions.
Install NVM To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL or Wget
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash  The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source line to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc,~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).

    <description><![CDATA[In the previous post, I wrote about how can we implicitly wire beans automatically in Spring container. In my previous post I created a new maven project and started writing code so that we can understand the topics more clearly. In this post, I am documenting my learning of how we can wire bean using Explicit Java Configuration. I will work on the same project I have created earlier.
Explicit wiring using Java When an automatic configuration isn’t an option then we must configure Spring explicitly.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[As we previously discussed that the Spring container is responsible for creating the beans in your application and coordinating the relationship between those objects vi DI. The act of creating these associations between application objects in the essence of dependency injection(DI) and is commonly referred to as wiring.
Different Types of Bean Wiring Spring Offers three primary wiring mechanism
 An explicit configuration in XML An explicit configuration in Java An Implicit bean discovery and automatic wiring  In this post, I am going to write notes about Spring&rsquo;s automatic wiring, I will write about the other two in later posts.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In the last post of Spring Diary, we discussed the basics of spring IoC Container and we saw a high-level view of how Spring Container works.
In this post, we will learn about how can we Instantiate a Spring IoC container(using ApplicaitonContext Interface) and configure that container using configuration metadata.
Spring IoC container consumes a form of configuration metadata. This configuration metadata represents how you as an application developer tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[There is some confusion these days over the meaning of inversion of control due to the rise of IoC containers.
An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement Inversion of Control (IoC).
Some people confuse the general principle here with the specific styles of inversion of control (such as dependency injection) that these containers use. It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Inversion of control (IoC) In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle. It is used to invert different kinds of controls. More Specifically invert the control of your custom written program or objects of a program is transferred to a container or framework.
In traditional programming, our custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.]]></description>
